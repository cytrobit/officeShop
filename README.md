# ToolShop - a webpage with a shopping cart

Its based on some Udemy course, however I have added some features like:
- RWD, 
- basket with red dot which says there are items in shopping cart (red dot vanishes when cart is empty)
- animated burger menu,
- another sections to make the page more...complex, 
- about section with some nice animations, 
- zoom in/out on items' photos (wrapped in container with overflow hidden)
- footer with FontAwesome fonts, 
- I also added counting total items value method and rearranged it to PLN curency
